"""Path contracts: rules about the steps a document may take, checked on every document.

A diff between two workflows can't tell a harmless change from a dangerous
one: search → order → retry → respond is fine, search → delete → respond is
not. So instead of diffing paths, Assay checks each document's path against
rules someone agreed to:

- must_include   step            every finished document ran it
- never          step            no document runs it
- before         step, other     when both run, step runs first
- only_after     step, other     step runs only once other has run
- max_runs       step, max_runs  at most this many runs of step per document (retries)
- allowed_steps  steps           nothing outside this list runs
- requires_approval  step        step runs only once it's approved (an approval step for it
                                 whose decision is "approved"; a later rejection takes it back)

A contract can be scoped with `when` (the document must match every listed
attribute) and `unless` (a document matching any listed attribute is exempt),
over segment, document_type and processing_mode. One break is enough to open
an alert: there's no baseline to learn and no sample size to wait for.

Changes that break no contract but move traffic (a new step, a branch whose
share jumps) are reported as shifts, judged against sampling noise, for a
person to look at rather than to page anyone.
