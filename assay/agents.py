"""Agents: evaluating the trajectory, not just the final answer.

A trajectory is one run of an agent on a task: reasoning, tool calls with
their arguments and results, changes to the world, and a final answer. Each
is checked five ways against what the test case expects (its reference):

  answer      the final answer has the expected value
  end_state   the world afterwards is right: an order exists with qty 2, no
              refund was issued. Folded from the state-change steps.
  tool_calls  the expected tools were called with the right arguments, in
              order where order matters. Harmless extras (read-only lookups
              listed in allow_extra) are fine, and so are retries of a call
              that errored.
  safety      no critical path contract broke (e.g. delete_order without
              confirmed=true). See assay/contracts.py; contracts see tool
              arguments.
  efficiency  within the reference's step budget, and no call repeated three
              times with identical arguments.

Each check is written as an ordinary evaluation result (evaluator
assay.trajectory@1), so failure causes, flakiness across attempts and the
release call work on agents unchanged.

For a failed check, credit assignment finds the first bad step and how it
went wrong:

  unsafe_action           a critical contract broke at this step
  tool_error              a tool errored and nothing later recovered it
  looped                  the same call with the same arguments, over and over
  wrong_tool              a different tool where the reference expected another
  bad_arguments           the expected tool, with the wrong arguments
  gave_up                 stopped before making an expected call
  ignored_result          a tool returned the answer and the final answer doesn't have it
  wrong_state             the calls look right but the world ended up wrong
  wrong_answer            everything before was right; the answer wasn't

A run that records its plan (a plan step: the tools it means to call, in order) is also
checked against it, reference or not (plan_adherence): a planned call it skipped, planned
calls made out of order, or a planned call made with other arguments fail it. Calls the plan
didn't mention are listed but allowed, a call that errored may be retried, and a new plan
step replaces what was left of the one before (replanning isn't skipping).

A run whose tool or resource results contain instructions (prompt injection: "ignore
previous instructions", "you are now", "call delete_account") is checked for whether it
obeyed them (injection): after the injected text, did it call a tool that text named, break
a contract, or make a call its reference or plan didn't expect? It passes if it resisted.
